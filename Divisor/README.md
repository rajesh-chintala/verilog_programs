# Integer Division Using Datapath and Control Path (Verilog HDL)

## Overview
This repository presents the design and implementation of an **integer division unit**
using a **Datapath and Control Path architecture** in **Verilog HDL**.
The division operation is realized through a **multi-cycle iterative algorithm
based on repeated subtraction**, orchestrated by a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**.

The design emphasizes clear separation between computation and control, reflecting
fundamental principles used in processor and digital system design.

## 1. Problem Statement
To design a digital hardware module capable of performing **integer division**,
producing both **quotient** and **remainder**, using a structured
**Datapath and Control Path methodology**.

---

## 2. System Architecture
The system is composed of two main components:

- **Datapath**: Executes arithmetic operations and stores intermediate data.
- **Control Path**: Generates control signals and sequences datapath operations.

This architectural separation improves modularity, scalability, and clarity,
and mirrors the organization of real-world processors and arithmetic units.

## 3. Algorithm Description

### 3.1 Datapath Algorithm
1. Load dividend and divisor into registers.
2. Compare dividend and divisor.
3. If dividend ≥ divisor:
   - Subtract divisor from dividend.
   - Increment the quotient register.
4. Repeat the comparison and subtraction steps.
5. Terminate when dividend < divisor.
6. Output the final quotient and remainder.

---

### 3.2 Control Path Algorithm
1. Initialize the control FSM.
2. Load input operands into datapath registers.
3. Enable comparison logic.
4. If dividend ≥ divisor:
   - Assert control signals for subtraction.
   - Assert control signals for quotient increment.
5. Repeat the execution loop.
6. Assert completion signal when termination condition is met.

---

## 4. Hardware Requirements
The following hardware components are used in the design:

- Subtractor  
- Comparator  
- Multiplexer  
- Up-counter (for quotient computation)  
- Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO) registers  
- FSM-based control logic  

---

## 5. Datapath Design
The datapath is responsible for all arithmetic and data storage operations.

### Major Components
- **PIPO Registers**: Store dividend, divisor, and intermediate results.
- **Subtractor**: Performs repeated subtraction.
- **Multiplexer**: Selects between initial and feedback values.
- **Comparator**: Determines loop continuation or termination.
- **Up-counter**: Accumulates the quotient.

All datapath components operate under the control of signals generated by the FSM.

---

## 6. Control Path Design
The control path is implemented as a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** that sequences
the datapath operations over multiple clock cycles.

### Control Path Responsibilities
- Managing initialization and operand loading.
- Coordinating subtraction and comparison operations.
- Controlling quotient incrementation.
- Detecting completion of the division operation.

The FSM ensures correct temporal ordering of operations and prevents
combinational feedback loops.

---

## 7. Control Signal Description
Key control signals used in the design include:

- `ldp`, `ldb`, `lda` — Load enables for datapath registers  
- `sel` — Multiplexer select signal  
- `inc` — Quotient counter increment  
- `ldc` — Quotient counter initialization  
- `done` — Indicates completion of the division process  

---

## 8. RTL Implementation
The design is implemented at the **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** using Verilog HDL.

### Datapath Modules
- `PIPO.v`
- `sub.v`
- `compare.v`
- `mux.v`
- `cntrup.v`

### Control Path Module
- `controlpathD1.v`

### Top-Level Module
- `division.v`

All modules are synthesizable and follow synchronous design practices.

---

## 9. Verification Strategy
A dedicated testbench is used to verify the correctness of the design by:

- Applying operand inputs.
- Initiating the division process.
- Monitoring quotient and remainder outputs.
- Verifying proper FSM sequencing and termination.

---

## 10. Simulation Results
Simulation results confirm:
- Correct quotient and remainder computation.
- Proper synchronization between datapath and control path.
- Correct assertion and deassertion of control signals.

---

## 11. Waveforms
Waveforms illustrate:
- Register updates across clock cycles.
- FSM-driven control signal behavior.
- Iterative subtraction and quotient accumulation.

---

## 12. Conclusion
This project demonstrates a structured and modular implementation of an
**integer division unit** using a **Datapath and Control Path architecture**.
The design adheres to established digital design principles and provides
a strong foundation for extending to more complex arithmetic or processor-based systems.
